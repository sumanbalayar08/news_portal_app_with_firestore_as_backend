# news_portal_app_with_firestore_as_backend

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In this app, we basically implement a news platform with firestore as backend.
We use cloud firestore to fetch the news into our app.
We then display the news according to various categories like International News, National, Sports and Political.
Thank You!
